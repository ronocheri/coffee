SmarTeam is for those with a need for design data management and have less-complex products and product lines that require single-discipline or single-site collaboration. These companies typically have little need for enterprise-wide product or process standardization and do not anticipate expansion to multiple sites either through organic growth or acquisitions. 

Small to mid-sized manufacturers and existing SmarTeam customers with a need for product lifecycle management (PLM), multi-discipline or multi-site collaboration, sustainable innovation, business applications leveraging PLM data, enterprise-wide quality management, integrated project management, requirements management or advanced change and configuration management should consider 3DEXPERIENCE ENOVIA.</p>
